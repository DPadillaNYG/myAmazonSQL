myAmazonSQL is an command-line application that works like an Amazon storefront using Node.js and mySQL. Customers can buy products and managers can view inventories, update stock, and create new items in the Amazon Marketplace.

### Skills Learned

I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife
who is also a very talented programmer and Stack Overflow. Here are some things
I learned and integrated into this project:

- mysql (npm package) / for connecting with MySQLWorkbench
- cli-table (npm package) / for clean display of terminal data
- MySQL CRUD Commands (minus delete)
- MySQLWorkbench _(refer to amazon.sql => code used within MySQLWorkbench)_

**Also, feel free to refer to the contents within the repository to see how I:**

- Created the database for amazon_db
- Seperated CRUD commands within functions
- Utilized inquirer (npm package)

### Comments

The biggest challenge I felt was figuring out the step by step process for each manager command in 'node amazonManager.js'. With a switch statement, I was able to run designated functions based on the option requested. Overall, mySQL is very powerful database and I look forward to using it in future full stack projects.
